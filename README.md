    Overview:
Introducing an interactive python chatbot built, using chatterbot and python 3.8. 

This project is an extension to [Python_Interactive_Chatbox](https://github.com/PamalM/Python_Interactive_ChatBox.git)

**Features implemented in this iteration of the project:**

- [5-Points]: Make a simple GUI so that the user is typing into a nicer interface and can view a recent history of the conversation. 

- [2-Points]: Add an extra topic to your agent's repertoire.

- [3 Points]: Add a feature that enables your agent to give at least 5 different reasonable responses when the user enters something outside the two topics.

**Please refer to the project documentation above for more information about the project. You can also refer to the Python_Interactive_Chatbox for a non-graphical version of this project. Please note!! You must be running Python 3.8 to execute this program.**

**Project documentation will contain screenshots of execution for your reference.**
